# learning-node-and-js

This is just a "playground" for me to learn javascript and node.js (and AngularJS and Express and ...)

I will create subdirectories that will be testing different features.  In some cases,
I will put multiple unrelated testcases in the same directory and in other cases,
a subdirectory will be for a full test case.

YMMV and use at your own risk.
